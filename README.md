# hello-world
This repository is for practicing the GitHub Flow.
I am learning how to code at the age of 34.
It is somehow surprising, however, I am enjoying this journey. 
Hopefully I will see the light at the end of the tunnel someday.
It is fun and exciting at the same time with being scary and uneasy.
